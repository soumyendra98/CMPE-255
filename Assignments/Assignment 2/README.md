PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Use pycaret to do low code data mining 

 

Pick for each task below a kaggle data set or some other data set (do not use the same dataset as what pycaretexamples use in official notebooks and my slides )

Implement run and provide output of the colabs of pycaret. Use full automl capabilities of pycaret

 

Train the models on gpu (use use_gpu=true method in setup function) if it supports for that capabilities (turn gpu on in google colab using youtube tutorial)

 

 

Binary Classification - Level Intermediate

Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables
Time Series Forecasting - Univariate with Exogenous Variables
(some examples - https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/tutorials (Links to an external site.) use different data sets)

Also do demo of atleast 2 examples in gradio -

SOLUTION

I have implemented all the models in a google colab file and used different datasets from Kaggle to do so.
The Link to the colab file is - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O30QHcphFz4HJWW6ssiICy_GOhDcGROd#scrollTo=-ZyJbXb8ccke
