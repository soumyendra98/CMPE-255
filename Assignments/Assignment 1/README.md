PROBLEM STATEMENT

Assignment 1 : Use  AI Pair Programmer(Github copilot) . 

As discussed you need to provide video of you using github copilot in visual studio code and having it code some interesting projects.

 

You can add any other coding like backend, frontend and html demos if you want.

Record and upload to youtube and put the link in github 

Some examples :

Also if you have any great extensions/tips you found in visual studio code, include that in the video and demo your setup.



SOLUTION

I explored Github Copilot with Python and used it to write some basic python code like Loops, Funcitons, Lambda funcitons, Classes and Inheritance in Python. The link to the youtube video is given below.
